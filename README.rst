`py_pet_exercise`
=================

The `py_pet_exercise` module implements a simple Python object to represent
a pet.

The requirements for the `Pet` object were as follows:

* Has attributes for pet name, kind (species), owner, and age;
* Provides property accessors for its private instance variables;
* Prevents a pet's species from being changed after instantiation.
